Hey, this is my first entry of this blog I'm starting, which is something I've been wanting to start for awhile. My friend Lizzy has a awesome site who's a inspiration for me starting my own blog, which her website can be found at [https://lizainslie.dev/](https://lizainslie.dev/)

Documenting my work and life through a private journal has been super fun and I'm hoping this would keep me more grounded as a person. To start, I'll go into my first journal entry February 24th, specifically focusing on some of the progress for a sentry bot I've been working on for my Applied Robotics course.

## robot go spin

To start, I'll mention the main pursuit of why even pursue this. Honestly, I kind of don't really care about the war applications of a autonomous turret essentially and I'm ethically against creativity through code used to harm people but the main problem I wanted to solve at hand is how do I get the xyz position of any arbitrary object from two cameras, essentially stereo distance through two cameras. The idea actually came from me wanting to replicate a electronic darts machine I used during my time in Japan in January of 2025. You could essentially think of it as a electronic dartboard but connected to something like a unity game, it's worth checking them out at [https://www.dartslive.com/jp/](https://www.dartslive.com/jp/)

One of the ideas when I was working on this was how would I actually get the position that the ball lands on the dartboard. Came across a ton of insane solutions like having a motor behind the dartboard with a hall sensor but the cheapest and most replicatable solution I came across was just using cameras to triangulate where the dart lands on the dartboard. It's honestly a project I've been off and on working on but goal I had was to make a inspired product to what the folks at Dartslive made.

Well aside from that rant, goal of the project is to use two cameras to triangulate where a ball might land then move a funnel to wear we think the ball is going to land. Once we catch the ball, the goal I had in mind is to use a solenoid to essentially fling the ball in the general direction of the person (or trajectory it came from, might bring scope down to trajectory). I think it's a pretty neat project I could use to learn about the art of how cameras recognize distance, which I found this awesome project with some cool math on making this work at [https://github.com/AlexJinlei/Stereo_Vision_Camera](https://github.com/AlexJinlei/Stereo_Vision_Camera)

Mostly, I've just been working on modelling the base for the stepper motor as of recent. There's a little bit of code that exists to move the motor I started but the main deliverable I want to achieve is modelling a v1 prototype for the pitch head. I've mostly just worked the bottom base so my parts actually connect, a silly sneak peak of the base can be found below:

There's a GitHub with the project too at [https://github.com/SebaSphere/ballcatcher](https://github.com/SebaSphere/ballcatcher), which I think it's also been a interesting experience to learn Kotlin. Honestly, it kind of feels like typescript but the JVM, honestly I could see myself using Kotlin more. Coroutines are also a very fun feature, which as a Java developer I really appreciate how easy it is to fire up threads with an easy-to-read syntax.

## homelab stuff
I had an interesting talk with one of my friends that inspired me to work on my homelab again. Honestly, my homelab has kinda been half sitting underneath my desk. I think my main issue is I haven't really had access to a stable internet connection good enough to run a homelab or access to port forwarding settings but I've honestly been inspired to work on it again. Some projects I have in mind include the following:
- **Multimonitor workstation setup:** One of the main things I want to do with my homelab is get a decent GPU and KVM switch, which would be great if I can just setup GPU passthrough on multiple VMs to switch easily between workstations. For my main desktop, I use Arch linux but I'd love a way to just easily switch between workstations for Windows exclusive workflows (ex: Fusion 360)
- **Remote proxy:** With the disadvantages of not having an actual internet I could port forward, I'd love to just setup something so I automatically proxy passthrough any specific ports I open. I use pfsense so would love a integrated panel where this is handled automatically for what I open. Essentially, I'd love to eep the public IPV4 address on a Miami based VPS.
- **Proper backup system:** The ideal setup for me would be a NAS with a backup server I can use for both media storage and automated backups from my proxmox machine. The ideal solution for me would be rolling backups of all my VMs on a NAS I'd buy on top of uploading to AWS glacier for longterm offsite backups.

Honestly, I feel like for me, the priority right now is getting a really good KVM switch and GPU for my three monitors, which is just an expense commitment for me right now. It'd allow me to easily switch between my current desktop computer, my future homelab, and anything else that I may want to dock.

I think when things get less hectic after the semester ends, this is definitely one of the projects I'd like to pick up again.

## a new outlook
From here, will get a little more indepth on my feelings with life and who I want to be so if you're not into that type of thing, welcome to skip to "insights from the beyond"

Recently, I've been having a new outlook in general for my life and how I interact with people around eachother, which was one of those things I feel like I've always struggled with. It's hard to put into words but I started medication I've been prescribed at the end of November, which one of the feelings I could describe helping me in is "feeling more human"; it's the best way to put it I've heard from people going through similar experiences from others I've talked with. I don't feel like a zombie going through the motions of life and I feel as if I'm actually enjoying the conversations I have with others and helping me express myself in more genuine and indepth ways. I still feel I can struggle with this sometimes + there's always more to improve but I'm doing better than ever, the world is a much more colorful and vivid place for me.

Another fact I've come to realize is removing the toxicity in my life and focusing on the positive. I've been reflecting a lot on some of the long-term relationships I've had for a *very very very* longtime and I've come to realize there's some toxicity I need to let go of. It hurts to let go of those people in my life but I feel for me, we only have so much limited energy and mental bandwidth in life. The drama doesn't matter and whose wrong or right isn't important, but I feel it's pivotal for our own limited resources of sanity and wellbeing to let go of those that cause emotional harm on oneselves. This is something I've reflected a lot on and hoping to continue living my new normal.

## insights from the beyond
> build cool shit... build cool shit... build cool shit... (Liz Ainslie)

I've been reflecting on my own journey as a developer and something I feel like is useful to know is that learning to build good software isn't a straightfoward path and you need to be obsessive over your passions. I feel it's something I've kinda gotten lost in the sauce for me since attempting my own fulltime business making Minecraft mods, focusing on other projects rather then my own. Mind you, most of the projects I worked on were super fun but I feel it's a unnecessary stress running direct product to consumer development in such a competitive and saturated market, it was especially demotivating to have back and forward messages with clients for hours for them to either offer pennies on the hour wage or end up ghosting me. When I did Minecraft mods on commission, my processes were extremely innovative through completion of full proposal documents and ongoing updates for the space and really wanted to see a better industry for developers through starting my own agency but professional development pricing is something that market doesn't support. I've always hated the developer "quote bidding" system of existing agencies out there, which is something I really wanted to fix at the time to pay developers fair project rates rather then having fellow developers go against each-other.

Something I've come to realize again by the YouTuber bigboxSWE (this guy makes awesome videos, great suggestion), is that getting "cracked" takes passion for the niches you're genuinely interested in. Do engineering for yourself to solve a problem you deeply care about, obsess over just achieving your goals and always hold passion for what you do. Another part of this I've realized is document what you do and how it's done, show others your work, and find those interested in what you're making.

I saw a talk from O'Reilly too called ["Making badass developers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM), it's a good video even outside of code but the main point of the talk that stuck out to me especially is **do not drain cognitive resources**. Especially when making our own projects, we only have so much cognitive resources so it's important to not make decision fatigue. I feel like this is something we can struggle with as developers, which while all good and all, overengineering our code can lead to not focusing on the big picture. Big design can always come later as our applications grow and expand, which this brings us to our next point.

## good code is like drilling for oil
I thought this was a very fascinating point from the video, which is especially relevant in the AI age we see ourselves coming into. I think this is relatable to any engineer that's used AI agents but extensive use can kinda give brainrot to me sometimes. Mind you I still use Junie (Jetbrains AI agent) a lot at work and agents are a tool useful to contextualize things fast but AI generated code can kinda sometimes give me brainrot. We are entering a new era of AI were agents seem to be taking over engineering principles, which I still see for the foreseeable future needing a engineer to design out implementations for "good and stable code". I thought Simon Willison has a super interesting blog on "[Agentic Engineering Patterns](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/)", which I think the point on using what you know to make a brand new feature is a great point to mention. I've been in the Jetbrains ecosystem for awhile but from the outside, Claude + clawbot seems super interesting and I've heard good things about them. From the bit I've tested this at my main job, it definitely seems interesting and I'll need to use it more to have a proper opinion on multi-agent engineering.

Another point from "Making badass developers" I need to remember to do more of is do then ask experts. Learning by doing then asking the experts on how to improve is a cool point I've subconsciously done but I didn't really realize till now. Surround yourself by cool people and talk about what you've done, which is something that I feel is kind of a skill dying with this new AI era. Honestly don't get me wrong that AI is great for research gathering but at the same token can also just hallucinate and cost unnecessary running in circles. It's an important tool keeping in mind validation and careful speculative thinking of the output. AI I feel can essentially a "yes man" in some cases so it's important to think carefully about the output.

## learning to project manage & my thoughts on management
With my availability going to both my main job and QA at fleet.ai, any work that comes in for Minecraft mod development has been lower priority and I haven't done as much development there. It's been awesome working with [Haki](https://github.com/ohakimen) to take over any projects that come in. This honestly sort of came out the blue, but through my commissions page, I got a project that would be worth my time if I wasn't busy with other responsibilities. It's enough to pay Haki enough as a living wage for the COL in Brazil + I feel is more rewarding and "fun" then Haki's previous developer role. Working with Haki has been awesome and I've enjoyed the informal daily standups of sorts I've taken part of to provide consistent feedback to make a great product. My goal is with the funds bootstrapped from that commission, continue working with Haki for the next few months to work on the darts project I had mentioned earlier in this post as a commercial product.

I've also been working at fleet.ai as QA, which while it pays very well (70$ an hour right now with the bonus going on!) I feel this isn't really my true passion. At fleet, I provide QA feedback for AI-prompted tool calls in different environments. I truly enjoy the engineering side so I feel while I totally could go full force and have "fuck you money" for a year, I care more about engineering at my main job, which something I've come to realize is that money helps but that isn't everything.

I still love the passion the company owners have for the field, wanting the best at individual niches. I don't 100% agree with a point brought up in one of the meetings but a point someone made was in every company, "80% of the work is done by 20% of a company". Nonetheless, I thought that was a super interesting point though of striving for the best and it reminds me of my time at Shockbyte with some of the core values that made the support department one of the best in the industry.
- Supportive leadership, always open to direct communication for specific feedback
- Structures in place to support the team and help individuals, weather it be dedicated experts or high encouragement to drop questions
- Quality over quantity, obsessing over the customer rather than pure numbers
- One on one regular and detailed feedback from leadership, telling where I did wrong, what I'm doing well, and where I can improve

In a company, transparency of operations and a culture of being passionate about what you do is important to me.

## conclusion
In all, I have a lot to look forward to and looking to continue to grow and learn. This was fun to write, looking forward to sharing my next project in the sauce.

Thanks for reading my spew of thoughts, this was super fun and looking forward to documenting what I'm working on more.

Peace, love, be gay do crimes
